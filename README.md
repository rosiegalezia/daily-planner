# daily-planner
A daily planner created for the Week 7 challenge


## Description


<!-- This is a JavaScript project utilising web APIs to create a timed quiz, storing the user's scores and initials to the local storage to create a scoreboard.

The quiz has four questions, showing the user if they were correct or incorrect before moving on to the next question.

The scoreboard in the highscores.html is not complete as I was unable to display any text there towards the end, this is something to improve in the next iteration.

The project was a good opportunity to practice the content learnt in Week 6 of the Front-End Web Development bootcamp. It was significantly more complex than previous assignments, and proved challenging, allowing me to learnt a lot about using multiple js files, accessing local storage and using JSON. -->
