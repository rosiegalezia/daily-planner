# daily-planner
A daily planner created for the Week 7 challenge.

## Description

This is a daily planner/organiser created to bring together content learnt in the bootcamp so far: Javascript, Web APIs and Third-party APIs.

Day.js is used to display the current date and time, and format the tasks on the planner based on whether they're past, present or future events.

JQuery is used to streamline the javascript and add additional functionality, and the user's tasks are saved to the local storage and retrieved when the page is refreshed.
